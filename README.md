**Mburnand-tech/MBurnand-tech** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

- Developed a dynamic, user friendly Social News Aggregation web application called NC_news, that presents articles categorised by various topics in a NAV bar at the top.
- The presentation of articles is dynamic, allowing users to view articles with sorting options such as date, comment count, and votes and to upvote/downvote articles and comments.
- A user can log in, which when done is shown by there avatar at the top of the page. Once logged in a user can leave comments on articles, where optimistic rendering confirms a successful comment or vote/unvote on either articles or comments of articles. 


- Designed NC-News back-end to mimic a real-world service like Reddit.
- Ensured high-quality code with 500+ lines of test-driven development using jest and supertest.
- Implemented GET / POST / PATCH / DELETE routes with optional sorting parameters (sort_by, order, topic, limit, pagination).
<Wrote clear and concise documentation for database setup and endpoint use>
