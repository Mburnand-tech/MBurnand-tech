### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, Matt Burnand's Github


This is where I am going to write a bio

NC-News Frontend project: link to project...

- Developed a dynamic, user friendly Social News Agrregation web application called '.... ' that presents articles that are categorised by various topics in a NAV bar
- The presentation of articles is dynamic, allowing users to view articles with sorting options such as date, comment count, and votes and to upvote/downvote articles and comments
- A user can log in (... and create a user account?), which is shown by there avatar at the top of the page. Once logged in a user can leave comments on articles, where optimistic rendering confirms a successful comment or vote/unvote on either articles or comments of articles. 

NC-News Back-end Project: nc-news

Designed NC-News back-end to mimic a real-world service like Reddit
Ensured high-quality code with 1000+ lines of test-driven development using jest and supertest
Implemented GET / POST / PATCH / DELETE routes with optional sorting parameters (sort_by, order, topic, limit, pagination)
Wrote clear and concise documentation for database setup and endpoint use
